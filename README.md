# R-markdown Repository for Example R Markdown files

Note, this README is just a "markdown" (**md**) document, wheras the **Rmd** files are for R. The Rmd files should be opened in Rstudio and "knitted" using the "knit" button to create beautiful software or scientific documentation. 

There are plenty of tutorials out there, but this is a nice repository demonstrating how to use them nicely.
